                <h2>AI isn’t close to becoming sentient — the real danger lies in how easily we’re prone to anthropomorphize it</h2>
                <p class="gray">Our tendency to view machines as people and become attached to them points to real risks of psychological entanglement with AI technology.</p>
                <span class="author">By <span class="underlined">Nir Eisikovits</span>, Professor of Philosophy and Director, Applied Ethics Center, UMass Boston</span>
                <p>ChatGPT and similar large language models can produce compelling, humanlike answers to an endless array of questions — from queries about the best Italian restaurant in town to explaining competing theories about the nature of evil.</p>
                <p>The technology’s uncanny writing ability has surfaced some old questions — until recently relegated to the realm of science fiction — about the possibility of machines becoming conscious, self-aware or sentient.</p>

                <h2>The 5 Most Important Laws of Fitness of All Time</h2>
                <p class="gray">Never before has information about fitness and health been so widely disseminated and easily accessible.</p>
                <span class="author">By <span class="underlined">Phill Rosen</span>Senior reporter, Business Insider. 2x Bestselling author. USC Trojan.</span>
                <p>A quick internet search yields innumerable diet plans and workout routines with catchy titles like “Get Ripped Quick!” or “Overnight Six Pack Abs!” These are all well and good, but they seem to gloss over the basics: the fundamental, non-negotiable parts of a healthy, fit lifestyle.</p>
                <p>The ability to move without aches, build muscle and shed body fat, walk long distances, and avoid bloating are all basic fitness needs that everyone should aspire to — they shouldn’t be outlandish goals reserved for professional athletes.</p>

                <h2>The Real Reason Every Fashion Company Is Now Making Face Masks</h2>
                <p class="gray">There’s a business case for why Gap, Zara, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Chanel are all racing to crank out masks

                <p>On April 5, I paid $13.99 for an LED sound-activated face party mask on Amazon that glows in time to the beat. It was one of the few under-$20 masks available that offered Prime shipping. What I bought is not a medical mask. The neon design offers no specific filtration protection from Covid-19. But technically, this rave mask is government approved.</p>
                <p>As of two days earlier, the CDC’s Covid-19 guidelines suggested that people wear “simple cloth face coverings” to cover their nose and mouth to help “slow the spread of the virus.” N95 masks are no longer supposed to be worn by the general public as priority shifts to frontline workers, who are experiencing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, surgical gloves, and gowns.</p>
